# 👋 Hi, I’m Elliot

I'm a developer with a second life as a designer and animator. I've spent my career between both development and design and like to combine the two in interesting ways to tell compelling stories. 

- 🌱 Currently learning: Rust 🦀 and Three.js ⟁
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on a bit of anything and everything. Especially 🌱 (climate), 🏃‍♂️ (wellness), 🎼 (music), and 📚 (education)
- 👀 See some of my work at: [ElliotKGoldman.com](https://ElliotKGoldman.com), [Technical Writing](https://github.com/Elliot-KG/Technical_and_UX_Writing/blob/main/README.md), or [Design Work](https://ElliotKG.com)

While not working I'm usually: 🌲🏃🧗🍵🧋🎨🥁🎹🎵🪡🧶🌲
